# todolist
This is a to-do list made in AnvilWorks. By implementing AnvilWorks python editor I was able to add C.R.U.D. functionality to a list of to-do's to create, read, update, and delete daily tasks. I customized the front end to be a little more user friendly.

Please see the to do list at the link below:
